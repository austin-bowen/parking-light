# parking-light

A device to help you park within a good region in your garage (i.e., complicated tennis ball).

Basically, the device will turn on a light to indicate you are within a good region to park, and it will rapidly blink the light to indicate you are too close.

Distance from the device to the vehicle is measured with an ultrasonic distance sensor. There are two buttons used to set the "close enough" distance, and the "too close" distance. These distance settings are saved to flash memory so they persist after a power cycle.
